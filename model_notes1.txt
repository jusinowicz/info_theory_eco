October 17, 2019: Here is a key point that I was missing: The fij are actually conditional probabilities, and NOT joint probabilities. This is highlighted in eqn. (5) and eqn (6) of Rutledge et al 1976. This makes a big difference to the math. Assuming that the fij are conditional probabilities, then it actually takes a little effort to extract the joint probabilities. From the definition of conditional and joint probabilities (using the notation of eqn 5 and 6) P(ak/bk)/P(ak) = P(ak,bk)/(P(ak)*P(bk)) because P(ak/bk) = P(ak,bk)/P(bk).  


October 3, 2019: The food web model becomes novel when we add compartments for wasted energy. An innovation that might turn out to be key is the fact that "waste" is essentially defined by the amount of biomass that is consumed by, but not used by the next trophic level up. This has the effect of scaling the biomass consumed into an "edible biomass." In an emprical setting, what we would want to know is the absolute biomass of an organism relative to that which has nutritional value -- presumably, the non-nutritional biomass is almost entirely related to structures etc that make the organism inedible, and so are themselves inedible.
