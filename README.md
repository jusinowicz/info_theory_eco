Using information theory to solve ecology

This repository is in its infancy. The ultimate goal is to solve ecological and evolutionary problems using tools from information theory that are currently applied to a range of problems in other disciplines. The starting focus is on using maximum entropy and entropy distance approaches to understand population dynamics, and the dynamics of competing species in particular. 

This repository currently contains:

1. Reworked examples of maximum entropy approaches for numerically solving best-fit distributions subject to (Lagrangian)
  
  constraints.max_ent.R: The only goal of this script is to start learning CVXR. Here, I reproduce the Maximum Entropy example from http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/r/maxent/maxent.html based on the CVXR Direct Standardization example from https://cvxr.rbind.io/post/examples/cvxr_direct-standardization
